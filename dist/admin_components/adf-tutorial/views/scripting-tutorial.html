<df-section-header data-title="'Scripts tutorial'"></df-section-header> <br> <p class="hero-example">DreamFactory supports server-side scripting to quickly and easily customize almost all of the platform's REST API endpoints to include business logic on the server, such as field validation, workflow triggers, runtime calculations, and more. Developers can easily attach scripts to any existing API endpoint, for both pre- and post-processing of the request and response. You can also write your own custom REST APIs with server-side script services. Starting with release 2.3.0, scripts can even be queued for later processing. </p>
